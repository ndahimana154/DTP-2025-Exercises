# Android Practicals — Firestore + Firebase Storage CRUD & SQLite Auth
**What this contains**
- A minimal Android Studio project skeleton (Kotlin) demonstrating:
  - Firestore CRUD (create/read/update/delete) with image upload to Firebase Storage.
  - SQLite-based Login and Signup activities.
- Files are ready; you must supply your Firebase `google-services.json` and enable Firestore & Storage.

**How to open**
1. Unzip `android_practicals.zip`.
2. Open the folder in Android Studio (File → Open).
3. Add your Firebase project `google-services.json` into `app/`.
4. Add your app's SHA-1 to Firebase if using Google sign-in (not required here).
5. Sync Gradle and run on a device or emulator (with Google Play services for Firebase features).

**Important**
- This is a teaching skeleton: production apps require input validation, error handling, security rules, and proper architecture.
- Replace package name `com.example.practicalapp` if you change it, and update `google-services.json` correspondingly.
