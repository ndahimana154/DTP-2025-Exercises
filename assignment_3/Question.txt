Q. Write a program to implement Quick Sort by taking middle element as pivot element. 
Also compute the complexity of this program. Explain it to me, and use Python.



🌈 WHAT IS SORTING? (Kid Version)

Sorting is like arranging things in the right order.

Example:

You have these toys:

🧸 🚗 🧸 🎈 🦖 🪀

They are mixed up!

Sorting means:

👉 Put them in order (small to big, A to Z, or 1 to 10)

So they become:

🧸 🧸 🚗 🎈 🦖 🪀

Sorting = making things neat and arranged.

🎁 WHY IS SORTING IMPORTANT? (Kid Version)

Sorting is important because it helps you:

✔ 1. Find things faster

Like when toys are arranged, you quickly find your favorite teddy bear 🧸.

✔ 2. Keep things neat

A neat toy box makes you happy 🌟.

✔ 3. Save time

If books or files are sorted, computers and people work faster.

✔ 4. Make searching easier

You can find numbers, names, or items quickly.

✔ 5. Computers need sorting for almost everything

💻 Searching
💻 Organizing files
💻 Ranking items
💻 Showing you best videos
💻 Online shopping
💻 Databases

Sorting helps computers think faster!

🎨 TYPES OF SORTING (Kid-Friendly Explanation)

Now I’ll explain different sorting types as if they are fun games kids play!

🟦 1. Bubble Sort

👉 Like bubbles popping in water.

You look at two toys:

🧸 🚗

If they are not in order, you swap them.

You keep comparing two toys at a time, moving big ones to the end…
Like big bubbles float to the top.

Slow but easy!

🟩 2. Selection Sort

👉 Like picking the smallest toy every time.

You check all toys…

Find the smallest one → put it first.
Find the next smallest → put it second.

Like picking the smallest apple from a basket 🍎.

🟧 3. Insertion Sort

👉 Like putting books on a shelf.

When you get a new book, you find the correct spot and slide it in.

Computers do the same:

Take one item → put it in the right place.

Very good for small lists.

🟥 4. Merge Sort

👉 Imagine splitting toys into two boxes, then sorting each box, then joining them.

Split toys into halves

Sort each half

Join them together like puzzle pieces

Very fast and organized.

🟪 5. Quick Sort

👉 Like the game we learned before 🎉

Pick the middle toy
Make small pile and big pile
Sort each pile
Put them together

Very fast for big lists!

🟨 6. Heap Sort

👉 Like building a toy mountain ⛰️

Put biggest toy at the top
Take it down
Rebuild the mountain
Repeat

Very stable and predictable.

🟫 7. Counting Sort

👉 Perfect when toys are numbers

If toys have numbers:

2, 5, 3, 2, 1

Count how many "1s", how many "2s", etc.

Then place them in order.

Fastest when numbers are small.

🧠 SUMMARY (Kid-Friendly)
Sorting Type	Kid Explanation
Bubble Sort	Pop bubbles (swap neighbors)
Selection Sort	Pick smallest toy each time
Insertion Sort	Put each book in its right place
Merge Sort	Split into halves, sort, join
Quick Sort	Pick middle toy, make piles
Heap Sort	Build a toy mountain
Counting Sort	Count toys with numbers
🌟 Why Sorting Matters (Big-Kid Version)

Sorting is used in:

Google search results

Online shopping prices

Ranking YouTube or TikTok videos

Organizing phone contacts

Arranging files or photos

Databases

Banking transactions

School grading systems

Sorting is one of the most important things in computer science.
